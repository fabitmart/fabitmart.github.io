This was my first teaching experience. I started co-teaching this course with Gigi Foster in Term 1 of 2019. 
It is a very ambitious module, aiming at giving the students a crash-course on the history of economic thought while linking those ideas to current policy issues. 
On top of that, it provide the students with the appropriate tools to read and critique economic texts. 
Their historical understanding of economic ideas and their ability to propose a policy based on available evidence is then evaluated in a 3000 words essay.

I taught and teach the Macroeconomis part, where I discuss issues of methodology in Macroeconomics (Is macro a science? what is good macro?) and introduce a selection of topics\subfields, 
such as the fundamental causes of economic growth, fiscal policy and the business cycle.
