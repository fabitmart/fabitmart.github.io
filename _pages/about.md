I am an empirical economist working on policy evaluation, ranging from assessing the impact of environamental awards to estimating the effect of increasing the exit cost from cohabitation on partnering choices. I am affiliated to the The Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course and I am passionate about using modern econometric techniques to answer relevant real-world questions. 

I have a strong interest in Epistemology and Philosophy of Economics, on which I wrote my undergraduate (Philosophy) dissertation. 

In my free time I bake (non-sourdough) long-fermentation bread and go Sydney's Fish Market to source the freshest fish. I enjoy cooking for others and preaching to them about Italian cuisine.

You can find me in Sydney, where I am an adjunct academic at the University of New South Wales.
