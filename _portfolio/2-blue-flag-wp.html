title: "Are municipalities in the red to go green? The Blue Flag case."
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "**Abstract.** I look at how being awarded for the first time an environmental beach award (the Blue Flag certification) affects a municipalityâ€™s balance sheet and its supply of collective tourist accommodation. I adopt a pooled event study approach using Italian data between 2002-2016 to evaluate the effects of a first-time Blue Flag certification on the awarded municipalities. I find that municipalities awarded with a Blue Flag for the first time significantly increase their revenues, while I find no evidence that the award leads to an increase in the supply of collective tourist accommodation supply. My findings also provide further evidence that, as proposed by Zielinski and Botero (2015), the Blue Flag award is an opportunity for mayors to promote and enact environmentally conscious infrastructural improvements."
