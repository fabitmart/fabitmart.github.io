title: "A Note on The Effect of Changing Domestic University Fees Under HECS."
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "**Abstract.** In July 2020, Education minister Dan Tehan announced changes in the government subsidies to some university degrees. Among these changes, there is a measure that would double the cost of a humanities degree for domestic students. Joining the debate on these proposed measures, I consider whether past increases in the cost of a particular degree have discouraged students from pursuing that discipline. I find even after the cost of pursuing a specific degree sharply increases, the trend in new enrloments does not significantly decline'."
